						<h1><strong>A Wordle Solver</strong></h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						I probably don't need to tell you what Worlde is, but I will anyways. Wordle is a
						daily word game where you have six tries to guess an unknown five letter word. When
						you make a guess, each letter's tile will turn one of three colors, where each color has
						its own meaning. If a letter is highlighted in grey, it means it is not in the word.
						If it turns yellow, it means it is in the word, but not at the spot, and if its green it
						is in the word and in the correct position. If you haven't tried it yet, it's pretty fun
						and this will make more sense. So here's a link: <a

					</p>

					<p>
						Now that you've tried it, we can move on to what I've been doing. I was talking to
						my family one night, and they said making a solver would be easy. I insisted that
						it would be a lot harder than they thought. But when they left, I went ahead and gave
						it a shot, and it actually wasn't that hard. So they were right. Thanks for the idea too!
					</p>

					<p>
						So here I will explain how my solver works and share some of the insights into the game that
						I've gathered from running a few thousand simulations with it. So without any further preamble,
						let's begin.
					</p>

					<h2>
						The Solver
					</h2>

					<p>
						The solver works by eliminating words that don't match what it knows is true, and then finding
						a new guess by scoring each of the possible remaining words and choosing one, and then repeating
						this process until it arrives at the right answer.
					</p>

					<h3>
						Eliminating Wrong Answers
					</h3>

					<p>
						There are four steps that my solver uses to eliminate all words that can't be the answer.



						<li><strong>Removing words that aren't in the solution</strong></li>
						For example, if we have a grey T, we remove all words that have T's in them.

						<li><strong>Only keeping the words with letters that must be in the solution</strong></li>
						If we have a yellow or green letter, we ignore all words that don't have those letters in them.


						<li><strong>Removing words with letters in the same position as yellow tiles</strong></li>
						If we have a yellow A in the first spot, we remove all words that have A in that first spot as
						well.
						This way we will always learn something new.

						<li><strong>Only keeping words with the same letters in green tiles</strong></li>
						If the word ends in g, we remove all words that also end in g.
